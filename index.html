    <h1>Does Martha Really Speak?</h1>
    <img src="images/martha-speaks.png" alt="Martha Speaks: Smiling cartoon dog">
    <p>Owner of talking dog claims that, upon accidently eating alphabet soup, Martha began to speak. Scientists are unsure of credibility of this claim but believe this could be the result of the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Alphabet soup traveled to her brain, instead of stomach</li>
      <li>Possessed by satanic demon</li>
      <li>Reincarnate of a child</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Martha states that she is most certainly not possessed by either a child or a demonic figure. However, she does remember eating alphabet soup the night before she began to speak.</p>
